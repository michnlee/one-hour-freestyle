# Code review - Day 14 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

For this challenge I went with a recipe concept.

For this I first structured and styled the navigation bar and all universal styles and once that was completed I then moved on to figuring out the recipe section.

At first I wanted to add a grid however, I quickly realized that it would take too much time for me to do as it is not my strong-suit. Once this was done, I wanted to create a way where the ingredient quatities and names could be aligned so that there is a clear distinction between qthe two for easier readability. which, upon my analysis, this could possibly be achieved by using a table. Also adding in checkboxes for users to be able to follow along while gathering their ingredients without getting confused.

I did however, use time inefficiently while creating the ingredients section due to wanting to find a solution to the problem stated above, which could have been put to use in other areas of this page to increase progress towards completion.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. Grid
2. Better ways to create a layout for a recipe section
