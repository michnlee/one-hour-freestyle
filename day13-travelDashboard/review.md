# Code review - Day 13 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

In this challenge I decided to create a dashbaord for a travel company and with this template I began with the dashboard and the navbar. Figuring out how I wanted the background image to be styled was a bit of a challenge as I initially wanted to put an opacity on it however, I was not too fond of how it was looking hence instead I did a background coor o the navbar and the body of the dashboard with a blurred effect.

After the navbar was finished being structured nd styled, I moved on to the body and created a form for the user to book a flight.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. More practice on dashboard templates
