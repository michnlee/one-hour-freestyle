# Code review - Day 12 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

I chose to do cards for day 12 of this challenge. I began with creating the container for all the crads to be held in as well as one card itself and assinging the displays for all elements.

This challenge was difficult for me compared to the others as I am yet to completely understand grid layouts and need to work some more on understanding this CSS property.

I attempted to use a span on the rows for a couple of the cards, however, it was not responding in the manner as expected as instead of the targeted card increasing the span to two grid rows, the cards surrounding the targeted card shifted.

Prior too the above attempt, I wanted to use a rotate on the Y axis to have a targeted card flip however, I am unclear as to why it did not rotate, hence the change in direction of the crad idea.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. Grid Layouts
2. Transform: rotate
