# Code review - Day 1 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

For this project, I began with all basic and essential HTML and CSS structures and styling, and focused on all necessary details first. Pseudo-classes were worked on at the end as well as any finetuning for the CSS styling and some HTML elements that were observed to need this attention to detail as well.

I would have liked to have the images in the companyInsight-container to have been in line with the text. I chose to use the float property to achieve this look. I realised that I need to research and practice this technique more.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

1. Less attention to finetuning things like margin and padding, inbetween as I had to make a conscious effort to leave it for last.

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. Float property
2. Practice with more layouts and how to style the elements to efficiently achieve the desired look.
3. Different styles of border-radius to achieve different effects with shapes.
