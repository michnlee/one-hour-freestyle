# Code review - Day 2 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

To maximise my time during this project, began working on elements I Knew I wanted to implement. I coded all the HTML that I knew I wanted on the page then I worked on the CSS from top to bottom. As I didn't 100% know what I wanted to do for this challenge I began with all universal elements and then proceeded to navigate through the styling as best as I could.

However, due to the unsurity of how I wanted to handle this challenge in terms of my end concept, this caused me to lose time whenever I needed to pause and think.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

1. Styling with grid layouts.

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. Varying template ideas.
