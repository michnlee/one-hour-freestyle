# Code review - Day 6 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

For this challenge I wanted to create a menu page. Inspiration was taken from the idea of a modern day Chinese tea shop using minimalistic colors to give the store a clean, warm and earthy feel whilst providing a sense of sophistication.

Since I already had the idea, I began with structuring and styling the navigation bar as well as styling any universal HTML elements that I knew needed styling. Once that was completed I moved on to the main body.

I then proceeded to work on the contents for the menu section. Once that was completed I styled the menu container using the grid property, which I had some complications with and need to continue learning and practing with. Afterwards, I proceeded to work on the remainder of the styling.

After the menu I decided to add in a small section for custoners to make reservations.

Whilst creating the structures and styling the page I continued to style the universal HTML elements that needed attention throughout the process.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

1. More grid

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. Continue researching and practicing the grid property.
