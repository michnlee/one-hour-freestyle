# Code review - Day 4 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

Beginning to work on the initial structure of the website I knew I wanted a navbar on the left hand side of the website but not how I wanted to display the information in the main sectioin of the website. So to maximise time I began working on building a shell of sections on the website as well as, creating the navbar with its information.

I then styled the navbar in its entirety as much as possible.

Once the navbar was completed, I moved on creating a basic structure of how the body could look. I spent too much time working on the first section's images as I wasn't sure how I wanted it to look and tried a couple different ideas. I eventually stuck with a simple design. However, I wasn't sure how I wanted the remainder of the website to look.
