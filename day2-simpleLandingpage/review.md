# Code review - Day 2 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

For this project, to ensure maximisation of time, once a basic layout was conceptualised, I first focused essential HTML content and structure, then the CSS stylesheet was next working from top to bottom as well as, starting with universal styles then targeting classes.

I then had the task of executing the CSS to execute the structure of how the content would be displayed. Basic font styling was added to all elements (using the asterisk) as well as a line height. All other universal elements were also given basic styling.

Pseudo-classes and a elements weren't styled in depth to allow for rmore concentration on CSS structure.

Although I had a basic idea of what I wanted the landing page to look like in the end, I struggled with going into a bit more in depth as I began the HTML structure since the order of the elements is important with how the order of the content is displayed.

I would have liked to stagger the position of content in the services section a bit more.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

1. Target all parent containers in terms of spacing between sections.
2. Target all elements that require the same style.
3. Target all single elements.

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. Different layouts to analyze the different methods used to improve effeiciency when creating a layout freestyle.
2. How to create a staggered look more efficiently, whether needng to affect the width and positioning or adding a second div and having the positioning adjusted.
