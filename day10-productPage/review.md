# Code review - Day 10 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

For day 10 of this challenge I wanted to reimagine a Coca-Cola product page and how the product information is is presented. In doing this project I worked on the HTML of the navigation bar first and styyled it as it was the least complictaed aspect of the project.

After this was completed, I had to find a way to present the information for the nutrition facts and to do so, I decided that it would be best if the information were in a table. This however, proved to be a challenge to style eg. the footer not being at the bottom of the table being the biggest challenge, then the editing of indentations.

The next challenge to styling this section was figuring out how to effectively place the image. I decided the best way to do this would be as a background image. This was definietky a challenge that took me a while to adjust and figure out. Eventually, I set a height and width on the background image and adjusted the positioning of the image so that it could appear on the right hand side of the page like I wanted.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. How to present nutrition facts as information.
2. Tables
