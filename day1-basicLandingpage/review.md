# Code review - Day 1 of OneHour Freestyle challenge 

## Summary 
For this project, to ensure maximisation of time, I first focused on the content for the HTML. Once the HTML structure was completed, I then moved on to 
CSS styling the sheet from top to bottom as well as, starting with universal styles then targeting classes.

In CSS I began with the basic structure of how the content should be displayed on the website. Afterwards, any additional styling on the content was 
done with adjustments on margin and padding being added where necessary. Pseudo-classes were also styled. During the CSS process some parts of the HTML 
structure were as tweaked as necessary for improvement in styling the structure. 

No font styles were added to the CSS as it is one of the least imporatnt areas structurally. Also, the only universal elements that were styled were all 
elements (using the asterisk), the body and the a elements.

Improvement with time management for CSS needs improving. Pseudo-classes can be styled once all important CSS elements have been completed along with 
the fine-tuning of margins and paddings.
