# Code review - Day 9 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

Day 9. I decided to syle an online newspaper layout, however I did not use grid for this task as I would have liked as in the beginning during my attempt I had difficulty with this. Due to this issue, I need ot research and practice more grid layouts to fully achieve the older newspaper styled look.

However, when working on this challenge I began the navbar and hero HTML and CSS structures and styling finetuning along the way. Once this was completed I then moved on to the next section of the site with the "business stories".

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

1. Grid Layouts

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. Grid Layouts
