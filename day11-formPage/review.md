# Code review - Day 11 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

I chose to do a form for a shipping company. I began structuring and styling the navigation bar firs as it was the easiest component to complete first.

Afterwards, I them proceeded to build the form with all the basic questions and style these elements as I go. I did run into some problems with styling the inout element onto the same line with the label as I forgot. During this process I also had to research hot to create the patterns in the input for the telephone numbers

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. How to get the label and its input on the same line.
2. Style the placeholder.
