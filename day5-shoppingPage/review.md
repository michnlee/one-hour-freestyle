# Code review - Day 4 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

I began working on the essential HTML and CSS for the the navbar and a shell of a structure for the hero container as I knew how I wanted it to look. Once that was done, I began working on finetuning the navbar and to add content to the hero container. I wasn't 100% sure how I wanted this container to look so I changed the layout a few times before coming back and settling on the original idea. I then realized I was spending too much time finetuning and wanting to get these sections styled as muc as posible however, I had to put this on pause as I realized I was spending too much time on this. I did not style the links for hover as this would have been taking away more time.

Once this hurdle was crossed, I immediately began working on the structure of the shopping section of the website. This gave me a small amount of trouble with the grid positioning.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

1. THe use of a grid layout.
2. Background images.

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. Practice with the grid property
2. More ways to add a background image and an overlay to the imagee
