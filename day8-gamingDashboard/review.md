# Code review - Day 8 of OneHour Freestyle challenge

## Summary

For day 8's challenge I decided to create a gaming dashboard. The part that gave me the most issues was working on the dashbaord and how to center it.

Once the dashboard background was built, I proceeded to build and style the navbar as the next challenge was to ensure it was sitting on the dashboard properly. During this process however, whilst trying to style the navbar links, the a element was not styling so I had to directly target the li element.

These took up the majority of my time before moving on to the hero section of the dashboard.

## What I would like to impliment in the next challenge

1. Grid Layouts

## What I need to research for quicker project turnaround

1. Learn more on creating dashbaords.
